Gemstone lenses can be used to control voltage and resistance. Gemstone lenses can be rotated to dial in voltage and resistance for extremely high currents without buring out. Gemstone lenses have very little interference or friction for electron travel and do not get hot. Components in electronics do not burn out because of Current. Components burn out because resistance in their circuits generates fricton in electrons and their pathways.  Volts=Current(amps)*Resistance(Ohms)  Watts/Volts=Current(Amps)  Flux is the ability for a capacitor to pass electrons without the electron coming into contact with another electron or surface friction from the component. Flux is the ability to distort the path of an electron so that it arrives at the other end at a controlled rate. Current resistors create a bottleneck to slow down electron flow. Bottlenecks create pressure, friction, and heat. Gemstone capacitors bend the path of an electron with a lense so that the electrons must follow a longer path to reach their destination. This elongated path also acts as a buffer to contain electrons on this elongated path. This type of resistor acts as a capacitor.  Time crystals:  If a crystal elongates the path of an electron. Time is literally dialated for an electron within this path. An electron could travel for 1 hour in a crystal and from the outside of the crystal we would see it only 1 second after pressing a switch.

Aperature

Aperature is the diameter of the input. Larger aperature allows for higher output with higher quality resolution. Higher aperature requires clearer, denser crystal.

Focal Length

Larger focal length allows more electrons to pass through lense. Harder to use lense without heating crystal. Meant for clearer, less-dense, or cracked crystals. Less focal length allows sending of very specific transmissions of data. The goal of the focal length is to achieve the highest throguhput at the most accurate focus.

Depth of Field

Depth of field is used to adjust the the diameter or area of the output. Depth of field can be used to output to larger or small guage components.

Converging and Diverging Lenses

Converging lenses condense the signal. Diverging Lenses Expand the signal. Dense crystals must be used to condense signal. Signal expanding is dangerous as the signal is made into analogue signal by the geometric lattice structure of the crystal. Sawtooth analogue waves create friction and combustion heat on contact with common materials. Signal expanding using crystal creates analogue waves which tear through materials like gamma rays. Water, saline, and frozen-hydrogen can be used as diverging lenses.

In traditional resistors, heat is generated by friction of atoms moving through bottlenecks. In crystal resistors, heat is generated by noise within the signal. When waves collide with each other from noise, friction and heat is created. When Noisy signals are focused onto smaller field depths, the heat of the entire signal is condensed into a smaller area. High-clarity, high-density crystals are useful to reduce heat when building quality circuits.
